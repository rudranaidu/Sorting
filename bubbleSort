In bubble sort we start from right to left and compare each element with its predessor (left element) and  bubbled up the min element to lefft by 
repeated exchanges. we wil continue this with n times.
In bubble sort no of swaps are more. In selection sort swapping operations are fewer.

Time complexity of Selection & bubble sort is O(n^2)
    
    
    static ArrayList<Integer> bubble_sort(ArrayList<Integer> arr) {
        // Write your code here.
        
        int size = arr.size();
        
        for(int i=0;i<size-1;i++){
            
            for (int right = size-1; right >= i+1 ; right --) {
                
                if (arr.get(right)< arr.get(right-1)) {
                    swap (arr, right, right-1);
                }
            }
            
        }
        return arr;
    }

static void swap(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int a, int b){
    int temp = arr.get(a);
    arr.set(a, arr.get(b));
    arr.set(b, temp);
}
